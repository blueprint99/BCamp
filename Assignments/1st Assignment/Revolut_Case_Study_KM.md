## Recommendations

<!--* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)-->
* Although recently Revolut has started to provide stock trading services, it can significantly improve its current trading platform, allow for more investment vehicles, like ETFs, and allow for different type of accounts, like retirement accounts, to be created aside from just regular investing accounts. By investing resources in its current trading platform Revolut could introduce automatic rebalancing portfolios, automatic reinvesting and other features that can be programable and tailored to its clientele. Additionally, as most companies, Revolut can benefit from the improvement of customer service.
<!--* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?-->
* By improving the current trading services Revolute provides they could potentially attract a larger audience and encourage its current userbase to be more engaged with all the company’s services. The introduction of different account types, like retirement accounts, could potentially help Revolut increase retention of long-term loyal clients.
<!--* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?-->
* Through the investment in technologies like machine learning and enhancements to its current API, Revolute can help introduce the additional products and services that have been recommended.
<!--* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?-->
* In a world of digital self-service, being able to provide an efficient and stress-free platform in which the client can comfortably make use of the services provided can make a significant impact. It could also help the company reduce cost that may arise if the client seeks support that requires live intervention. With supplemental machine learning technology Revolute could provide strategies or solutions at a low cost that can be meaningful to the client.
